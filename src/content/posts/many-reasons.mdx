# ManyReasons

A utility class for managing multiple reasons or conditions that can be added and removed dynamically. It's particularly useful for tracking multiple independent reasons why something should be in a particular state.

## Features

- Track multiple reasons using unique identifiers
- Automatic state management with callbacks
- Promise-based temporary reason tracking
- Parent-child relationship support
- Type-safe implementation

## Basic Usage

```typescript
const reasons = new ManyReasons();

// Add a reason
const cleanup = reasons.add('loading');

// Remove the reason
cleanup();

// Or remove directly
reasons.remove('loading');
```

## Callbacks

```typescript
const reasons = new ManyReasons();

reasons.onChange = (hasReasons) => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ¯ Reasons state changed:', hasReasons);
};

reasons.onEmpty = () => {
  console.log('âœ¨ All reasons cleared');
};

reasons.onNonEmpty = () => {
  console.log('ðŸ”” First reason added');
};
```

## Promise-based Usage

```typescript
const reasons = new ManyReasons();

// Add a reason that will be automatically removed when the promise resolves
reasons.addDuring('loading', fetchData());
```

## Parent-Child Relationships

```typescript
const parentReasons = new ManyReasons();
const childReasons = new ManyReasons();

// Make parent reasons affect child reasons
parentReasons.makeParentTo(childReasons);

// When parent has reasons, child will automatically get them
parentReasons.add('parentReason');
// childReasons now has the parent reason
```

## Debugging

```typescript
// Helper function to debug multiple reason maps
const debugReasons = <T extends Record<string, ManyReasons>>(map: T) => {
  return Object.assign(map, {
    toString() {
      return Object.entries(map)
        .filter(([, reasons]) => reasons instanceof ManyReasons && reasons.hasAny())
        .map(([key, reasons]) => `"${key}": ${reasons}`)
        .join('\n');
    },
  });
};
```
