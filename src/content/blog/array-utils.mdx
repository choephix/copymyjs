# Array Utilities in TypeScript

A collection of useful array utility functions I've created in TypeScript.

## Chunk Array

Sometimes you need to split an array into smaller chunks of a specific size. Here's a utility function that does exactly that:

<CodeSnippet file="array/chunk.ts" />

### Live Example

Here's how you can use the chunk function:

<Example component="chunk-example" />

Try clicking the button to see how different chunk sizes affect the result!

## Performance Considerations

When working with large arrays, the chunk function is quite efficient as it:
- Creates only one new array for all chunks
- Uses Array.from for optimal memory allocation
- Avoids unnecessary array copying

## Common Use Cases

The chunk function is particularly useful for:
- Batch processing large datasets
- Creating paginated views
- Managing API request batches
- Organizing data for grid layouts
