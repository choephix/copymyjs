# Pick Object Properties

A type-safe utility for creating new objects with only the properties you need.

## Basic Usage

The pick function lets you safely extract specific properties from objects:

<CodeSnippet file="object/pick.ts" />

### Live Example

See how the pick function works with a user object:

<Example component="pick-example" />

## Type Safety

Our pick function maintains full type safety:
- Prevents picking non-existent properties
- Preserves property types
- Works with optional properties

## Common Applications

### API Response Filtering

```typescript
const fullResponse = await api.getUser(id);
const publicData = pick(fullResponse, ['id', 'name', 'avatar']);
```

### Form Data Processing

```typescript
const formData = pick(event.target, ['username', 'email']);
```

## Performance Tips

- Use pick for shallow copying only
- Consider object destructuring for simple cases
- Cache results when picking from large objects
